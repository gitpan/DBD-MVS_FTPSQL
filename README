DBD::MVS_FTPSQL  - DBI  driver to  query IBM  DB2 mainframe  databases
through an IBM FTP server.

SYNOPSIS

    require DBI;
    
    #DSN String that identifies the DB2 subsystem
    my $DSN = "hostname=...;ssid=..." ;
  
    #A mainframe account able to perform SELECTs  
    my ($username, $password) = ('...','...');
    
    my $dbh = DBI->connect(  
      "dbi:MVS_FTPSQL:$DSN"
     ,$username 
     ,$password
    ) or die "Cannot connect: " . $DBI::errstr;
  
  It  connects  to the  DB2  subsystem $ssid  of  the mainframe  whose
  hostname  is $hostname.  Refer to  the DSN  string section  of this
  document for details on matching the configuration of the  mainframe
  you want to connect to (in particular the attributes hostname,  port
  and ssid).  It could  be a  good idea  to take  also a  look at  the
  EXAMPLES section below.

DESCRIPTION
  This module lets you submit SQL queries (that's it, only SELECTs) to
  an IBM  mainframe of  the s/390  family provided  that the  IBM z/OS
  Communications Server on the  mainframe side was installed  with the
  (optional) SQL query function enabled  and you have a valid  account
  for that  system (you  must have  a writable  home directory  on the
  system and be able to submit queries via QMF).

PREREQUISITES
  This driver relies on the following other perl modules:
    Carp
    DBI
    IO::File
    Net::FTP
  In order for this module to be of any use you need to have access to
  a mainframe  that runs  an ftp  server  configured for executing SQL
  query via FTP (see  the support  and documentation  section  of this
  README).

INSTALLATION
  The recommended installation procedure is the automatic installation
  via the CPAN module:
    perl -MCPAN -e "install Bundle::DBD::MVS_FTPSQL"

  To install this module manually, run the following commands:
    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install

SUPPORT AND DOCUMENTATION
  After installation, you can find  documentation for this module with
  the perldoc command:
    perldoc DBD::MVS_FTPSQL
  
  For information about installing the SQL query function on the s/390
  mainframe,  refer  to  the  IBM  z/OS  Communications  Server  -  IP
  Configuration Guide.
